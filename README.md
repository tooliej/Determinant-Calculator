# Determinant-Calculator
Found this determinanat calculater that I was curious to program after learning about determinants in my Linear Algebra course a few months into my degree.

Not so efficient when it comes to space, but cut me some slack seeing that my coding skills were very limited at the time.
Does the job :)
